# DSA-KMS-PROJECT-DOCUMENTATION
My first portfolio building where i discussed the dsa (kms) project that was given to me

## PROJECT TPOIC: Kultra Mega Stores Inventory

## PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This report breaks down KMS's performance based on sales, customers, and shipping. It’s grouped into three parts: Sales Analysis, Customer Analysis, and Shipping Analysis. Each part answers important questions to help the company find ways to make more money, spend less, and serve customers better.

### Data Source
The analysis in this project draws from two key datasets—“KMS SQL Case Study.csv” and “Orders_Status.csv”—which were obtained through the DSA LMS Dashboard. These datasets serve as the foundation for uncovering insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and order management.

### TOOL USED
- SQL Server(Utilized for querying and data analysis) [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)

### Data cleaning and Preparation
During the initial phase of data preparation, the following steps are carried out:  
1. Loading and inspecting the dataset  
2. Identifying and addressing missing values  
3. Cleaning and formatting the data for analysis
